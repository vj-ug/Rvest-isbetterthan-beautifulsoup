Scraping ads in CraigList to analyze correlation on type of ads with time they were posted.

What do users like to sell on which day and can we predict this trend to give offers to users?

Another suggestions thanks @Greg  is to find sold out concerts tickets still on sale on Craiglist
and display them alongside concert information pages using a Chrome Extension!

- Note Craiglist does not allow scraping for commerical purposes. This is just an educational project.

The R script is private as Craiglist policy does not allow scraping. However please email/message me and I'll be happy to share the code with you.
